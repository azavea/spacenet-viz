# Spacenet Viz

This is an application for viewing the [SpaceNet](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/) dataset and results from Azavea's Raster Vision project applied to SpaceNet.

### Requirements

* Vagrant 1.8+
* VirtualBox 4.3+
* Ansible 2.2+

### Getting Started

#### Quick setup

Make sure you have a `geotrellis` profile in your aws-cli profiles, with keys that can access
your data on S3.

Clone the project, `cd` into the directory, then run `./scripts/setup.sh` to create the Vagrant VM and then build the Docker container(s).

`setup.sh` can also be used to restore the project to its initial state: it will re-provision the VM, then remove and rebuild the Docker container(s).

Note: this will destroy the VM's existing Docker container before rebuilding it.

#### To run just the UI server

```
./scripts/setup.sh
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
./scripts/server.sh
```

### Ingesting data

#### Downloading test data

`make load-local` will download the necessary data. Make sure you environment variable `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` is set to the correct profile.

#### Using Docker in the VM

The other project scripts are meant to execute in the VM in the `/vagrant` directory. To run the container during development use the following commands:

    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    ./scripts/server.sh

## Running on EMR

_Requires_: Reasonably up to date [`aws-cli`](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

### Configuration

 - [config-aws.mk](./config-aws.mk) AWS credentials, S3 staging bucket, subnet, etc
 - [config-emr.mk](./config-emr.mk) EMR cluster type and size
 - [config-run.mk](./config-run.mk) Ingest step parameters

You will need to modify `config-aws.mk` to reflect your credentials and your VPC configuration. `config-emr.mk` and `config-ingest.mk` have been configured with an area over Japan. Be especially aware that as you change instance types `config-emr.mk` parameters like `EXECUTOR_MEMORY` and `EXECUTOR_CORES` need to be reviewed and likely adjusted.

### EMR pipeline example

```bash
make upload-code && make create-cluster
make ingest-paris
```
